# The Ever Lasting Operating System

## Introduction

This project is just an over-simplification of an operating system that I want to make in the future. Usage and build is described below in the README.

## Usage

To use the program you must have Python (Prefferably Python 3.11)

Go to src/ and then click ELOS.py

## Build from source

For now building from source isn't supported
