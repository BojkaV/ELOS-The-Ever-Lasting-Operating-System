# The Ever Lasting Operating System

## Introduction

This project is just an over-simplification of an operating system that I want to make in the future. Usage and build is described below in the README.

## Usage

To use the program you must have Python (Prefferably Python 3.11.2)

Go to src/ and then click ELOS.py

## Password

When you enter ELOS it will ask you for a password. The password by default is blank. To set the password you need to go to /src/reg/passwd and modify it however you like.

## Build from source

For now building from source isn't supported
